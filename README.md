# **Backpropagation from Scratch - Regression Problem**

## **Overview**

This repository demonstrates the implementation of backpropagation from scratch using Python, applied to a regression problem. The goal is to manually implement the core 
backpropagation algorithm and compare its performance with a pre-built solution from the Keras library. The regression task aims to predict continuous values, and we evaluate 
the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss.
