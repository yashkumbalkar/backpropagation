# **Backpropagation from Scratch - Regression Problem**

## **Overview**

This repository demonstrates the implementation of backpropagation from scratch using Python, applied to a regression problem. The goal is to manually implement the core 
backpropagation algorithm and compare its performance with a pre-built solution from the Keras library. The regression task aims to predict continuous values, and we evaluate 
the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss.

## **Tools Used**

- `python`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `Tensorflow`
- `keras`

## **Conclusion**

We can see that our algorithm has a loss of 1.28 after 10 epochs and algorithm from keras library has a loss of 1.06 after 75 epochs, So our results are similar.
